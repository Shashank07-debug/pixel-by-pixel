    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
      My name is Shashank. I am currently pursuing my MTech in Computer
      Science and Engineering. I’m passionate about full-stack development,
      problem-solving, and building modern web applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m actively learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from platforms like
      Frontend Masters. I practice DSA daily and am working toward mastering Java, RESTful
      APIs, Spring, Spring Boot, React, Three.js, Blockchain, and core CS subjects.
    </p>

    <p>
      My goal is to become a highly skilled full-stack developer and secure a
      top-tier tech job by the end of my MTech.
